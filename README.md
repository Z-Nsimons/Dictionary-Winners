This project involves implementing functions to normalize email addresses, count occurrences of emails in a file, filter unique emails, and select a random "winner" from a list of eligible emails. Each function is aimed at handling a different aspect of managing email data, particularly for cases where email normalization and deduplication are necessary (such as in giveaways or contests).
